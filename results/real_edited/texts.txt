The idea bchind this classic Neapolitan dish is simple-fry avegetable. then marinade it in nice bits.Courgettes aren't famedfor their strong flavour, which is why they are perfect for thisprocess and,whats more, they are cheap as chips and go a longway. In frying. they become sweeter and nuttier, which works sowell with the tangy vinegar and fresh mint.
Heat the vegetable oil in a large frying pan (skillet) over a mediumheat to around 170C 340F.
To be served with the Baked Onions and Homemade Ricottasee page 74
Drain the excess oil from the courgettes briefly on kitchen paper(paper towels),before popping them into the bowl of marinadeand stirring well. Continue until you have fried all the courgettesand they are all well mixed together.Leave to sit in the marinadefor an hour or so at room temperature.
Meanwhile, mix the olive oil, vinegar. garlic and a couple of decentpinches of salt together in a large bowl or dish and set aside.Thiswill be the marinade.
Working in batches so as not to overcrowd the pan,fry thecourgettes in a single layer in the hot oil until they are lightlygolden on both sides. You will need to turn the slices at least once,but they won't take more than a couple of minutes on each side.
To serve, mix through most of the shredded mintsaving some togarnish.Drizzle over some more extra virgin olive oil, if needed,and serve with crusty bread
